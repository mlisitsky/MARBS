# Matthew's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts (LARBS)

This is a fork of Luke Smith's LARBS project, customized for my particular needs, using my configs instead of his and installing a few extra programs that I like to use. If you are interested in this concept and would like more information, check out Luke's repo for details.

To use:

```
curl -LO https://github.com/mlisitsky/MARBS/blob/master/marbs.sh
bash marbs.sh
```
